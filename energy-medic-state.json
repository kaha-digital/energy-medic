You discussed in detail what my work might require and did offer to discuss further with me when you came to view it. When I prompted you via text to send me the quote, you apologised in response and sent me the quote directly via email. On planning forward, you arrived to do the job when you said you would. On the day, you and your helpful offsider were very polite to me when you needed to enter the house. When you told me afterwards that you did patch up a gaping part of my sidewall roof section with silicon ‘while you were up there’ was the added bonus. All very good communication and a most excellent service. I would recommend you to anyone.",
